## Hi there 👋

I learnt programming with ☕ Java, done professional work in the dotnet space and learned 🐍 Python in order to contribute to [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) and give back.

Currently mostly using Python and Kotlin and trying to learn 🦀 Rust.

I am maintaining the travel time integrations on Home Assistant:

* [HERE Travel Time](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/here_travel_time/)
* [Google Travel Time](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/google_travel_time/)
* [Waze Travel Time](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/waze_travel_time/)

I created the GitHub Actions [setup-rye](https://github.com/eifinger/setup-rye) and [setup-uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/setup-uv).
